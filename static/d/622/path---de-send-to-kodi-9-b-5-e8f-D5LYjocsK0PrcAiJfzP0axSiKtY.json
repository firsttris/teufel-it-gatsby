I have an Odroid XU4 with Retropie and Kodi installed. I have it set up to a projector with a 100” screen. I had a Chromecast hooked up to it but I wanted retro gaming on my screen. My Samsung phone can do what this app does with the official Kore app but on with the Kodi remote app on ios. So I downloaded this to get the same functionality. It works! I honestly only cast youtube, youtube music, and rarely Plex. This app is not going to give you the full Chromecast experience but for me it’s perfect due to my casual use.","rating":"5","title":"Turned my Odroid XU4 into a Chromecast!"},{"name":"","text":"","rating":"","title":""},{"name":"siesstad","text":"I added the source, but there seems to be no Zip-file at this address so I can’t install the repository.\n\nHelp?","rating":"1","title":"Can’t install"},{"name":"Adrian Ilie","text":"exactly what i was looking for","rating":"5","title":"perfect"},{"name":"nomnomade","text":"Un grand merci pour cette app simplissime mais qui fonctionne nickel !","rating":"5","title":"Merci !"}]}}
